An array is used as the underlying data structure in MyArrayList, an implementation of the MyList interface.
MyArrayList:
The size() function provides the list's element count.
If the list includes the given entry, contains(Object o) returns true.
add(Object item) moves the chosen element to the list's end.
add(Object item, Int index) adds the given element to the list at the given index.
Removes the first instance of the given element from the list using the function remove(Object item).
remove(int index): Removes the entry from the list at the given index.
clear() eliminates every item from the list.
get(int index) returns the entry in the list at the given index.
Returns the index of the first instance of the supplied element in the list through the indexOf(Object o) function.
lastIndexOf(Object o)  method returns the index of the last instance of the given element in the list.
sorts the contents of the list in ascending order using the sort() function.

To guarantee that list items are similar, the MyLinkedList class makes use of a generic type E that extends the similar interface.
